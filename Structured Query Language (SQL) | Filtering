Structured Query Language (SQL): It's a relational database as they can relate data across multiple tables through defined relationships.

Accessing SQL from Linux:
Command: Enter sqlite3 (or other SQL version command) in the Linux command line to access SQL.

Differences Between Linux and SQL Filtering

1. Purpose:
Linux: Filters data in files and directories. Useful for searching files, managing permissions, or processes.
SQL: Filters data within a database management system. Useful for querying and manipulating data in tables.

2. Syntax:
Linux: Uses varied commands and options. Examples include find, sed, cut, grep.
SQL: Uses standardized language with specific keywords and clauses. Examples include WHERE, SELECT, JOIN.

3. Structure:
Linux: Free-form and less organized. Data is often printed as lines of text.
SQL: More structured, with data organized in columns. Easier to select and analyze specific columns.

4. Joining Tables:
SQL: Can join multiple tables to return combined data.
Linux: Cannot directly connect and join data from different sources.

5. Best Uses:
SQL: Ideal for structured data stored in databases. Common in cybersecurity databases.
Linux: Ideal for unstructured data stored in text files or logs not compatible with SQL.

6. Practical Use Cases
SQL: Use when dealing with structured data in databases, where complex queries and joins are required.
Linux: Use when dealing with file system data or logs in text format, where SQL is not applicable.
