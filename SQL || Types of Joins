Types of Joins:
1. Inner Join
INNER JOIN returns rows matching on a specified column that exists in more than one table.

Syntax:
SELECT *
FROM employees
INNER JOIN machines ON employees.device_id = machines.device_id;

2. Outer Join
Outer joins expand what is returned from a join. Each type of outer join returns all rows from either one table or both tables.

A. Left Joins
LEFT JOIN returns all the records of the first table, but only returns rows of the second table that match on a specified column. 

Syntax:
SELECT *
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN machines ON employees.device_id = machines.device_id;

B. Right Joins
 RIGHT JOIN returns all of the records of the second table, but only returns rows from the first table that match on a specified column. 

Syntax:
SELECT *
FROM employees
RIGHT JOIN machines ON employees.device_id = machines.device_id;

3. Full Outer Joins
FULL OUTER JOIN returns all records from both tables. You can think of it as a way of completely merging two tables.

Syntax:
SELECT *
FROM employees
FULL OUTER JOIN machines ON employees.device_id = machines.device_id;
