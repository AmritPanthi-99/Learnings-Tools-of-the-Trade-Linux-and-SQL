In this course, I learned about the operating system, Linux and Structured Query Language (SQL). I am going to write a note on my undestanding on these two topics.
Linux:
Talking about the linux, this operating system is widely used in the cybersecurity field as it can be customized which allows security professionals to tailor the operating system to their specific requirements and also it offers the powerful command lines.

Linux Archhitecture:
User: The one who interacts with the computer.
Applications: A program that performs a specific task. In linux, a package manager is used to install applications.
Shell: Its a command line intepreter. Everything we enter into the shell is text based. The shell allows users to give commands to the kernel and receive responses from it. Its basically a translator between the user and the computer.
Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS): The component of the Linux OS that organizes data. It specifies the location where data is stored in the operating system. A directory is a file that organizes where other files are stored.
Kernel: The component of Linux OS that manages processes and memory. It communicates with the applications to route commands. It controls all major functions of the hardware.
Hardware: Its a physical component of a computer such as hard drives, CPUs. It is categorized as either peripheral or internal. 
Peripheral devices: Hardware components that are attached and controlled by the computer system.They are not the core components that are needed to run the computer system. Examples: Monitors, mouse, printers, keyboard.
Internal hardware: The components that are required to run the computer system. It includes a main circuit board and all components are attached to it. Examples: CPU, RAM, Hard Drive.

Linux Distributions:
Kali Linux: Open-source distribution of Linux that is widely used in the security industry. It is debian-based and is pre-installed with many useful tools for penetration testingand digital forensics.
Ubuntu:
