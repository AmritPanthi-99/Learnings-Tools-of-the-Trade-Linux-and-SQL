In this course, I learned about the operating system, Linux and Structured Query Language (SQL). I am going to write a note on my undestanding on these two topics.
Linux:
Talking about the linux, this operating system is widely used in the cybersecurity field as it can be customized which allows security professionals to tailor the operating system to their specific requirements and also it offers the powerful command lines.

Linux Archhitecture:
User: The one who interacts with the computer.
Applications: A program that performs a specific task. In linux, a package manager is used to install applications.
Shell: Its a command line intepreter. Everything we enter into the shell is text based. The shell allows users to give commands to the kernel and receive responses from it. Its basically a translator between the user and the computer.
Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS): The component of the Linux OS that organizes data. It specifies the location where data is stored in the operating system. A directory is a file that organizes where other files are stored.
Kernel: The component of Linux OS that manages processes and memory. It communicates with the applications to route commands. It controls all major functions of the hardware.
Hardware: Its a physical component of a computer such as hard drives, CPUs. It is categorized as either peripheral or internal. 
Peripheral devices: Hardware components that are attached and controlled by the computer system.They are not the core components that are needed to run the computer system. Examples: Monitors, mouse, printers, keyboard.
Internal hardware: The components that are required to run the computer system. It includes a main circuit board and all components are attached to it. Examples: CPU, RAM, Hard Drive.

Linux Distributions:
Kali Linux: Open-source distribution of Linux that is widely used in the security industry. It is debian-based and is pre-installed with many useful tools for penetration testingand digital forensics.
Ubuntu: It has both command-line interface (CLI) and a graphical user interface (GUI).
Parrot: Similar to Kali Linux. 
Red Hat Enterprise Linux: It is a subscription-based distribution of linux. It is not free.
CentOS: It is a open source and it uses a source code published by red hat to provide a similar platform.

Navigate Linux and Read File Content:
Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)
FHS organizes data in Linux, defining directory structures and contents.
Root Directory: Represented by /, it's the highest level in the hierarchy.
Standard Directories:
/home: User home directories.
/bin: Binary files and executables.
/etc: System configuration files.
/tmp: Temporary files, accessible to all users.
/mnt: Mount point for media like USB drives.
User-specific Subdirectories: Found under /home, can be represented by ~.
Navigating the File System
Absolute Path: Full path from the root, e.g., /home/analyst/projects.
Relative Path: Path from the current directory, uses . for current and .. for parent directory.
Key Navigation Commands
pwd: Prints the current working directory.
Use whoami to find the current username.
ls: Lists files and directories in the current or specified directory.
cd: Changes the current directory.
cd .. moves up one level.
Reading File Content
cat: Displays full file content.
head: Shows the first 10 lines by default; use -n to specify a different number of lines.
tail: Shows the last 10 lines by default; useful for log files.
less: Displays file content one page at a time, with navigation controls:
Space: Forward one page
b: Back one page
Down Arrow: Forward one line
Up Arrow: Back one line
q: Quit
