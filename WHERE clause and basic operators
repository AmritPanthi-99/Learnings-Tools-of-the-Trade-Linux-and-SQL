Importance of Filtering in SQL for Security Analysts:

Purpose: Filtering in SQL helps security analysts manage and analyze large, complex security logs efficiently.

Use Cases:
- Identifying login attempts by specific users.
- Finding login attempts during a specific security event.
- Detecting devices running particular application versions.

Using the WHERE Clause
- Function: The WHERE clause sets conditions for filtering data in SQL queries.
Example:
SELECT firstname, lastname, title, email
FROM employees
WHERE title = 'IT Staff';
- This query returns only the employees with the title 'IT Staff'.

Filtering for Patterns with Wildcards and LIKE Operator

Purpose: Allows filtering based on specific patterns rather than exact matches.

Wildcards:
- Percentage Sign (%): Represents any number of characters.
- Underscore (_): Represents a single character.

Usage Examples:
a%: Matches any string starting with 'a' (e.g., apple123, art, a).
a_: Matches any two-character string starting with 'a' (e.g., as, an, a7).
%a%: Matches any string containing 'a' (e.g., again, back, a).

Using the LIKE operator
- Function: Used with 'WHERE' tosearch for patterns with column values.
Example:
SELECT lastname, firstname, title, email
FROM employees
WHERE title LIKE 'IT%';
- This query returns all records with titles starting with 'IT', such as 'IT Staff' and 'IT Manager'.
Example:
SELECT firstname, lastname, state, country
FROM customers
WHERE state LIKE 'N_';
- This query finds all customers in states with abbreviations starting with 'N' followed by any character (e.g., NY, NV, NS, NT).

Summary of Wildcard Patterns
Pattern	    Results that could be returned
a%	        apple123, art, a
a_	        as, an, a7
a__	        ant, add, a1c
%a	        pizza, Z6ra, a
_a	        ma, 1a, Ha
%a%	        again, back, a
_a_	        Car, ban, ea7
