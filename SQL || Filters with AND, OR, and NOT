1. Using AND Operator
Function: Combines two conditions that both must be true for a record to be returned.

Example:
SELECT firstname, lastname, email, country, supportrepid
FROM customers
WHERE supportrepid = 5 AND country = 'USA';

- This query returns customers handled by a support representative with ID 5 and located in the USA.

2. Using OR Operator
Function: Combines two conditions where at least one must be true for a record to be returned.

Example:
SELECT firstname, lastname, email, country
FROM customers
WHERE country = 'Canada' OR country = 'USA';
- This query returns customers from either the USA or Canada.

3.Using NOT Operator
Function: Negates a condition, returning records that do not match the specified condition.

Example:
SELECT firstname, lastname, email, country
FROM customers
WHERE NOT country = 'USA';

- This query returns customers not located in the USA.

4. Combining Logical Operators
Purpose: Allows for more complex filtering by combining multiple conditions using AND, OR, and NOT.

Example:
SELECT firstname, lastname, email, country
FROM customers
WHERE NOT country = 'Canada' AND NOT country = 'USA';

- This query returns customers who are neither in Canada nor in the USA.

5. Pro Tips and Alternatives
NOT Alternatives: Use <> or != to find values not equal to a certain value.
WHERE country <> 'USA' or WHERE country != 'USA' is equivalent to WHERE NOT country = 'USA'.

6. Examples of Logical Operator Usage
Scenario: Finding Specific Customer Data
AND Operator Usage: Identify customers handled by a specific representative in a particular country.

SELECT firstname, lastname, email, country, supportrepid
FROM customers
WHERE supportrepid = 5 AND country = 'USA';
OR Operator Usage: Identify customers in either of two countries.

SELECT firstname, lastname, email, country
FROM customers
WHERE country = 'Canada' OR country = 'USA';
NOT Operator Usage: Identify customers not in a specific country.

SELECT firstname, lastname, email, country
FROM customers
WHERE NOT country = 'USA';
Combining Logical Operators
Combining NOT and AND: Identify customers not in two specific countries.

SELECT firstname, lastname, email, country
FROM customers
WHERE NOT country = 'Canada' AND NOT country = 'USA';
